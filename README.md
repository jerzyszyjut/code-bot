# Code Bot

Code sending discord bot made for roleplay server purposes. Based on Discord.js and SQLite database.

It was created hastly for Minecraft role play server I was part of. It generates unique code for each user and keeps track of codes in database. It logs sent codes and allows to regenerate codes for each user, so it can send different codes to same users on different servers and during different time periods in order to avoid code fraud.
